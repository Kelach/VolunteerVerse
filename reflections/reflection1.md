## Reflection Questions

* We developed several models and routes (volunteer, and organization routes and models). We also developed a landing page and registration pages for both our user roles

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Learning how to test our models using Jest was very difficult, but we were fortunate to get help from the instructors and our peers.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We did not get through all of our planned tasks for the sprint primarily because we did not realize how difficult implementing testing would be. Now that we've a better understanding of how to test, we can work on that more effectively. In addition, we will continue working on the registration process for users on the front end and connect registration with the backend.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Learning about different design patterns during one of the optional lectures helped us learn more about how we can tackle some of our tasks. The support from our instructors and peers on testing was also very helpful

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 We don't think any features and user stories for our MVP are at risk. We have some strecth features (e.g. email verification) that may be at risk of not being completed
